# Molokai-dmod Color Scheme for Vim

Molokai-dmod is a modification of the Vim port of the monokai theme for TextMate originally created by Wimer Hazenberg.  
Compared to original point, it doesn't do that annoying thing with parenthesis.  

## Installation

`Plug property404/molokai-dmod`  
`color molokai-dmod`
